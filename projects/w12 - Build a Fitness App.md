## Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You'll be setting up and using the database schema for a simple habit tracking app.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.

## Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned about data storage in a SQLite database on Android. This is critical if you want to make any app that persists a user's data over time or syncs with an online database for offline use.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we've been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Creating a SQLite table in your app
- Populating that table with new entries
- Modifying the entries
- Displaying the contents of the table to users.

## Build Your Project
For this project, you'll be setting up and using the database schema for a simple habit tracking app. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.

First, define and setup up the database schema (i.e. table and columns) that can be used to help a user keep track of their habits (e.g. walking the dog, practicing the saxophone, taking any medications). Then, create 2 methods that insert and read data to/from your database. These 2 methods can all be contained in a single Java file.

## Additional Criteria
The intent of this project is to give you practice writing raw Java code using the necessary classes provided by the Android framework; therefore, the use of external libraries will not be permitted to complete this project.
