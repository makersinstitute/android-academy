## Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making a class to represent a report card.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a ReportCard Java Class which would allow a school to store a student's grades for a particular year. This project will be just a java class, rather than a full Android app.

## Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned about custom classes, which are critical to every object-oriented program you will build going forward. It is vital to be able to think about how to design objects which interact with each other and model real-world concepts.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we've been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Designing a custom class
- Creating that class in Java code.
- Storing information in an array
- Looping through an array

## Build Your Project
For this project, you'll be creating a single Java class file. The class file is intended to represent a report card.

You'll want to think about what information report cards have and what methods a report card might need. These will be different depending on the educational system you would like to model. For instance, some systems use a letter grading system where the grades are "A,B,C,D,F" and some use a numeric system where a grade would be represented as a percentage.

There are some things that a report card will always do and some things that a report card will never do, however. Report cards never teach classes, so a teach() method would go instead in a Teacher class. Report cards always show a student's grades, however, so your class should include some way to do that. It may be useful for you to read over this page on the toString() method before starting your project.
