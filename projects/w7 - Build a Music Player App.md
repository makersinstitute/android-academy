## Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making the structure of a music app using intents and empty activities.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play audio files. There are many music player apps, and they make a wide variety of design choices. It will be your job to decide what kind of music app your structure would turn into and build out that structure using intents. Will you build an app to play music from the userâ€™s library of music? Will you build an app to stream random songs from a database? Will you build a musical suggestion engine? Those choices are up to you!

## Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned how to think about the structure of an app and how to use OnClickListeners and explicit Intents to link between different activities within your own app. Practicing these skills will drastically improve the quality of the apps you build down the road.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
Creating new activities
Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app.
Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.

## Build Your Project
For this project, you will be thinking deeply about the structure of an app and laying out that structure in Android.

- First, take a look at different kinds of music player apps. If you're having trouble, check out the Play Music app, the Pandora Radio app, and the Spotify app to start with.

- Think about what kind of music player you would like to build. Will you make a streaming app? One that plays music from the device's library? Will you make a music discovery app?

- Once you've chosen, write out a couple of ways you could structure your app. Think about where a user will start and what the most common use case of the app will be.

- Select a potential structure and create an app with that structure in Android Studio. Your app should have 3 to 6 Activities. Some ideas for Activities would be:
  - "Now playing" screen
  - List artists, albums, playlists, or podcasts
  - Detail screen or screens for individual artists, albums, or podcasts
  - Store screen for buying music online
  - Search screen

- Each Activity should contain a TextView which tells a user the point of the screen, and what technical hurdles there are to implementing the screen. You should also add a collection of buttons indicating what Activities can be reached from the current one. Use OnClickListener objects to make your buttons change Activity using Intents.

- Finally, do some research on the technical hurdles and add a potential solution to each screen. The solution could be Android libraries or classes, an API on the internet, or code you could plan on writing. You do not need to actually implement any functionality. The only required components are the TextViews explaining each Activity and the buttons that allow the user to change Activity.
